# Habito

Habito is a fun gamified automated habbit tracker, it uses Realtime wearables data in order to
track our customers habbit.
Like any habbit app, you can use a habbit to track and change, but what does it make stand
out?
-Habito has 4 main pillars:
### Automation:
Habito tracks your habits automatically so that saves you the trouble of having to enter your
health data (calories taken, sleep, hydration) which can get tedious when repeated daily
### Customized:
most habit apps give goals for habits based on the recommended average. but actually, these
goals can be unrealistic is there are a lot of variables that go into calculating the right dose for
a specific person. Habito takes that into account and sets goals for your habits tailored to your
body, goals, and daily activity.
### Reward:
instead of using a punishment system when you don't keep your habits, Habito uses a reward
system for when you do! the concept is simple, Bitos are an in-app currency that you gain by
keeping your habits daily. you can, later on, use your Bitos to claim real-life rewards These
rewards can be coupons, promo codes or referral links to products, available in our store.
### track chronic diseases
We maximize the use of the data from wearables by using AI to predict if our customer has
chronic disease, like Diabetes or heart disease. When we detect that the Customer has a
chronic disease, we notify him so he can start treating the disease in its early stages.
